# Chatbots

"A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot)

1. Flask (Python) + Heroku
2. [ManyChat](https://manychat.com)

- For the Facebook deployment on a page, I needed an actual business registration file + a contract that I needed to sign. So no facebook deployment for now. As it is my first time developing on Facebook, the actual deployment code is inspired by this [great guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/facebook-chatbot-python-deploy).
